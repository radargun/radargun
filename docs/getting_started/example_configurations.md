Example configurations
----------------------

Following benchmark [configuration]({{page.path_to_root}}benchmark_configuration/general.html) files can be found in `/conf` folder of [built](./building_binaries.html) project.

**NOTE:** When working with external application builds always check you have appropriate version, in case of weird errors check again.
