JGroups plugin for RadarGun
===========================

Plugin measuring the costs of remote gets and puts with JGroups, with regular arguments passed by RadarGun.
However, a GET returns a *prefabricated* value (no cache handling) and a PUT simply invokes the remote call,
but doesn't add anything to a hashmap.

The point of this plugin is to measure the overhead of Infinispan's cache handling; it is a base line to the
Infinispan plugin. The Infinispan plugin should be slower than the JGroups plugin, but the difference should always
be constant, regardless of the cluster size.

Properties, such as the size of the layload for gets, and the number of owners of a key, can be
defined in jgroups.properties.

IMPORTANT: note that the ClusterValidation stage in benchmark.xml has to be commented for the JGroups plugin to work;
since the JGroups plugin does *not* maintain a cache (a hashmap), validation by putting and getting of keys won't work !
